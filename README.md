### The brief 

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information about our Solar System in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

A user should be able to:

- View some educational content on the planets in our Solar System
- Retrieve information from an external API and display it on the page
- Be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

### Extensions

- Create a quiz that allows the user to test their knowledge about the Solar System
- Calculate score for each taken quiz and store them in a database
- Display a Leaderboard (Top 10)
- Use charts or maps to display your information to the page

### Technologies used
- JavaScript
- Vue.js
- MongoDB
- HTML, CSS
- Bootstrap
